## My Task 🎯

Describe what you would do to integrate all company data to forecast demand and optimize routes. You should consider the scenario described by the company, the data, and the available technologies. You may propose alternatives if you consider it necessary to solve the business problem. Not all information may be available in the description above **[ Simulating what you will encounter in real life ]**. The goal is to assess how you will handle this. It is recommended that you describe the solution in a file on your computer to organize your ideas. **[It is not necessary to send the file].** Once you have organized the solution, answer the questions. **[All your decisions and choices must be justified].**
